Multidimensional Arrays
========================

As of 0.9 (dev) MyHDL has a limitation compared to Verilog and 
VHDL.  Both Verilog and VHDL support multidimensional arrays.
MyHDL does not directly support multidimensional array conversion.  
In the HDL context an array is typcially a homoogenous collection
of multi-bit vector types.

<!-- 
  need some term definition on vectors and arrays, and introduction
  and links to the list-of-signal (LoS) documentation.
-->

It should be noted that multidimensional list-of-signals work

VHDL Arrays
-----------
VHDL has many abstraction tools and multidimensional arrays has
existed in VHDL from the beginning.

### VHDL Multidimensional Example
The following is a variant of a multidimensional array example
from.  This example demonstrates how multidimensional arrays 
can be created in VHDL. 
    
```vhdl
  type t_cube is array (3 downto 0, 3 downto 0, 3 downto 0) of unsigned(31 downto 0);
  signal mdarray : t_cube;  

-- accessing the array
process begin
    -- ...
    if (wr = '1') then
      mdarray(islc, irow, icol) <= data_i;
    else
      data_o <= mdarray(islc, irow, icol);
    end if; 
end
```

Verilog Arrays
--------------
In the Verilog 2001 standard (1394-2001) multi-dimensional arrays
were added [reference].  Prior to this multi-dimensional arrays 
were not supported and many open-source Verilog simulators still
do not support multi-dimensional arrays [reference].  Although there
is limited support in the open-source tools the 2001 standard is 
over 10 years old and commonly used by many developers.

MyHDL List-of-Signals (Array)

<!-- review exisiting LoS and any conversion info -->

MyHDL Multidimensional Arrays

### Existing Description
<!-- review exsisting options and limitations
md-arrays can be used in modeling, but not conversion
-->

### Proposed Description

<!-- list-of-list-of-signals convertible 
describe how the md-arrays are built and the expected 
conversion results.
