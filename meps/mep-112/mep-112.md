Multidimensional Arrays
========================

As of 0.9 (dev) MyHDL has a limitation compared to Verilog and 
VHDL.  Both Verilog and VHDL support multidimensional arrays.
MyHDL does not directly support multidimensional array conversion.  
In the HDL context an array is typcially a homoogenous collection
of multi-bit vector types.

<!-- 
  need some term definition on vectors and arrays, and introduction
  and links to the list-of-signal (LoS) documentation.
-->

It should be noted that multidimensional list-of-signals work in 
modelling it is only a conversion issue.

VHDL Arrays
-----------
VHDL has many abstraction tools and multidimensional arrays has
existed in VHDL from the beginning.

### VHDL Multidimensional Example
The following is a variant of a multidimensional array example
from.  This example demonstrates how multidimensional arrays 
can be created in VHDL. 
    
```vhdl
  type t_cube is array (3 downto 0, 3 downto 0, 3 downto 0) of unsigned(31 downto 0);
  signal mdarray : t_cube;  

-- accessing the array
process begin
    -- ...
    if (wr = '1') then
      mdarray(islc, irow, icol) <= data_i;
    else
      data_o <= mdarray(islc, irow, icol);
    end if; 
end
```

### Another VHDL Multidimensional Example
Another way to declare a multidimensional array is to declare subtypes iteratively:
```VHDL
	type cols   is array (3 downto 0) of unsigned(31 downto 0);
	type rows   is array (3 downto 0) of cols;
	type planes is array (3 downto 0) of rows;
	signal tcube : planes;

begin
	process(clock)
	begin
		if (rising_edge(clock)) then
			if (wr = '1') then
				tcube(slc)(row)(col) <= data_i;
			end if;

			data_o <= tcube(slc)(row)(col);
		end if;
	end process;
```
###  Comparing the two different implementations
#### At the VHDL Level
The _true_ 3D type,
```VHDL
type t_cube is array (2 downto 0, 2 downto 0, 2 downto 0) of unsigned(31 downto 0)
``` 
can be seen as a cube, depicted in this picture:   

![3 * 3 * 3 objects](./cube-matrix-cropped.png)

The _nD_-type can be easily used as a module port because the _fully unconstrained_ type declaration ```type cube is array (natural range <>, natural range <>, natural range <>) of unsigned; -- VHDL2008!```
can be made in a _general_ VHDL _package_. 
But updating each object must be atomically, e.g.:
```VHDL
type t_col  is array (2 downto 0) of unsigned(31 downto 0)
type t_cube is array (2 downto 0, 2 downto 0, 2 downto 0) of unsigned(31 downto 0)
signal mdarray : t_cube;
signal col : t_col;

mdarray( 0, 0 ) <= col ; -- illegal, missing lowest index for mdarray
mdarray( 0, 0, 2 downto 0 ) <= col ; -- illegal too!, (type mismatch)

for i in 0 to 2 loop
	mdarray(0,0,i) <= col(i) ; -- correct
end loop ;
```
As a    

The _stacked_ 1D x 1D x 1D type 
```VHDL
type cols   is array (2 downto 0) of unsigned(31 downto 0);
type rows   is array (2 downto 0) of cols;
type planes is array (2 downto 0) of rows;
```
has a rather flat representation. Note that the _even_ objects  (_unsigned(31 downto 0)_ and _rows_) are stacked horizontally, and the _odd_ objects (_cols_) vertically.  The picture show how we get to an eventual 1Dx1Dx1D of _object_

![3 * (3 * (3 objects))](./expanded-stacked_1D-hor.png)

Accessing a _stacked_ m1D type is a lot more versatile, as
```VHDL
type cols   is array (2 downto 0) of unsigned(31 downto 0);
type rows   is array (2 downto 0) of cols;
type planes is array (2 downto 0) of rows;
signal tcube : planes;
signal row   : rows;
signal col   : cols;

tcube(0)(0) <= col ;   -- valid
tcube(1)    <= row ;   -- valid
tcube(2)(1) <= row(2); -- valid
```

#### At the RTL Level
At least in Quartus II, after Analysis and Synthesis, there is **no difference** between the RTL Schematics!  


Verilog Arrays
--------------
In the Verilog 2001 standard (1394-2001) multi-dimensional arrays
were added [reference].  Prior to this multi-dimensional arrays 
were not supported and many open-source Verilog simulators still
do not support multi-dimensional arrays [reference].  Although there
is limited support in the open-source tools the 2001 standard is 
over 10 years old and commonly used by many developers.
